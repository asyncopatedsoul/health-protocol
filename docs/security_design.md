## without Memgraph enterprise
Based on my research, here are several comparable solutions to Memgraph Enterprise's Label-Based Access Control (LBAC) that can be implemented without requiring the enterprise version:
1. Application-Level Access Control
This is the most flexible approach that works with any graph database, including Memgraph Community:
With application-level access control, the privacy logic is implemented in the "resolve" function which produces values for specific graph elements. Access control checks are performed before returning any data to users. Stack Overflow
Implementation approach:

Create middleware that intercepts queries
Add user context to each query
Modify queries to include filters based on user permissions

For example, in your application layer:
pythondef execute_query(query, user_id):
    # Modify query to include user-specific filters
    if "MATCH" in query and not is_admin(user_id):
        # Add filters based on user permissions
        query = query.replace("MATCH (n)", f"MATCH (n) WHERE n.owner_id = '{user_id}'")
    
    # Execute the modified query
    return db.execute(query)
2. Role-Based Access Control with Graph Modeling
You can implement RBAC directly within your graph model by creating special nodes and relationships to manage access control. Roles are represented as nodes within the graph, with each role node encapsulating permissions that define what actions users can perform. Dgraph
Implementation steps:

Create role nodes and permission nodes
Link users to their roles
Add ownership properties to data nodes
Add query preprocessing to enforce permissions

This approach embeds access control into your data model rather than requiring database-level features.
3. Multi-Database Approach
Neo4j's multi-database capabilities enable tenant isolation to help organizations adhere to privacy regulations. This approach restricts who has access to specific information within an organization. Neo4j
For Memgraph Community, you could:

Run multiple Memgraph instances, each containing data for different security domains
Use an API gateway to route queries to the appropriate database based on user credentials
Join results only at the application level when a user has cross-database permissions

4. Data Partitioning with Tags
Create a simple tagging system within your data model:

Add a "visibility" property to all nodes and relationships
Store permission tokens in the visibility property (e.g., "public", "team_finance", "admin_only")
Modify all queries to include visibility filters based on user permissions

cypher// Example query modification for a user with "team_finance" access
MATCH (n) 
WHERE n.visibility = 'public' OR n.visibility = 'team_finance'
RETURN n
5. Property-Based Security Patterns
Neo4j is enhancing its RBAC implementation to enable access control based on property values, allowing control of READ, TRAVERSE and MATCH privileges based on specific property values. GitHub
You can implement a similar approach in Memgraph Community by:

Adding security property tags to nodes (e.g., security_level: "confidential")
Creating access control lists as separate nodes
Building a query preprocessor that adds appropriate filters

6. GraphQL Layer with Permission Directives
If your application uses GraphQL:

Implement a GraphQL API layer on top of Memgraph
Use GraphQL directives to specify access control
The resolver functions can incorporate permission checks before querying the database

This approach provides fine-grained access control at the field level rather than at the node/relationship level.
7. Custom Views with Query Rewriting
A graph database access control solution allows both top-down and bottom-up queries for determining which resources a user can access and who can modify access settings. Neo4j
You can:

Create "view" definitions for each user role
Implement a query parser that rewrites incoming queries to include the appropriate visibility filters
Cache commonly used query patterns to improve performance

Practical Implementation Example
Here's a simplified example of how you might implement application-level access control:
pythonclass GraphDatabaseAccessControl:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.db = db_connection
        self.user_roles = {}  # Cache user role information
        
    def get_user_permissions(self, user_id):
        # Get cached or fetch from database
        if user_id not in self.user_roles:
            # Query to get user permissions
            query = f"MATCH (u:User {{id: '{user_id}'}})-[:HAS_ROLE]->(r:Role) RETURN r.name"
            roles = self.db.execute(query)
            self.user_roles[user_id] = roles
        return self.user_roles[user_id]
    
    def execute_query(self, query, user_id):
        permissions = self.get_user_permissions(user_id)
        
        # Check if user is admin (full access)
        if "admin" in permissions:
            return self.db.execute(query)
            
        # For regular users, rewrite queries to include permission filters
        modified_query = self._rewrite_query_with_permissions(query, permissions)
        return self.db.execute(modified_query)
    
    def _rewrite_query_with_permissions(self, query, permissions):
        # Simple example - in practice would need a more robust parser
        if "MATCH" in query:
            # Add visibility predicates based on permissions
            visible_types = []
            for perm in permissions:
                if perm.startswith("view_"):
                    visible_types.append(perm[5:])  # Extract type from "view_Type"
                    
            visibility_clause = " OR ".join([f"n:{type}" for type in visible_types])
            query = query.replace("MATCH (n)", f"MATCH (n) WHERE {visibility_clause}")
            
        return query
These approaches offer alternatives to Memgraph Enterprise's LBAC without requiring enterprise features, though they do place more responsibility on the application layer to enforce access control policies.


## Memgraph Enterprise
Based on my research, I can recommend several approaches to implement privacy of nodes and relationships in Memgraph on a per-user basis. Memgraph Enterprise offers robust Label-Based Access Control (LBAC) features that allow fine-grained control over what data users can access.
Using Label-Based Access Control (LBAC)
Memgraph's label-based access control is hierarchically structured to enable authorization on node labels and relationship edge types. This lets database administrators maintain all data in a single database while keeping private data secure from users without adequate permissions. Memgraph
The permission levels available in Memgraph's LBAC system are:

NOTHING - Denies visibility and manipulation of nodes and relationships
READ - Allows only viewing nodes and relationships
UPDATE - Allows viewing and editing properties
CREATE_DELETE - Allows viewing, editing, creating, and deleting nodes or relationships

Implementation Steps:

Create user roles with appropriate privileges:
cypherCREATE ROLE dataAnalyst;
GRANT MATCH TO dataAnalyst;

Create users and assign them to roles:
cypherCREATE USER Bob IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';
SET ROLE FOR Bob TO dataAnalyst;

Grant node label permissions:
Grant permissions to specific node labels using:
GRANT permission_level ON LABELS label_list TO user_or_role; Memgraph
For example:
cypherGRANT READ ON LABELS :Customer TO dataAnalyst;

Grant relationship type permissions:
Similarly for relationships:
GRANT permission_level ON EDGE_TYPES edge_type_list TO user_or_role; Memgraph
Example:
cypherGRANT READ ON EDGE_TYPES :PURCHASED TO dataAnalyst;

Grant or deny access to all labels and edge types:
cypherGRANT CREATE_DELETE ON LABELS * TO admin;
GRANT CREATE_DELETE ON EDGE_TYPES * TO admin;

Handle exceptions with NOTHING permission:
When you need to hide specific nodes or relationships from a user who otherwise has broad access, you can use:
GRANT NOTHING ON LABELS  TO user_or_role; Memgraph

Real-World Example
Here's a practical example of how user permissions might be structured in an organization:

Admin Role: Has complete access to all nodes and relationships
Analyst Role: Can view (READ) certain nodes but not modify them
Engineer Role: Can create and modify (UPDATE) certain data
Tester Role: Can update properties but not create/delete nodes Memgraph

Multi-Tenant Architecture Considerations
For applications serving multiple customers where each customer's data must be isolated:

Data Segregation with Labels:

Label nodes with tenant identifiers (e.g., :TenantA, :TenantB)
Create user roles per tenant and restrict access accordingly
Example: GRANT READ ON LABELS :TenantA TO tenantARole;


Relationship Privacy:
Even if a user can see certain nodes, they won't see relationships between them unless explicitly granted permission to the relationship edge types. Memgraph
Whitelisting Approach:
Since users are initially created without any permissions, they need explicit grants for every new label that appears in the database. This "whitelisting" approach prevents confidential nodes and relationships from being leaked before they're properly secured. Memgraph

Implementation Best Practices

Create an admin user first:
cypherCREATE USER admin IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO admin;
GRANT CREATE_DELETE ON LABELS * TO admin;
GRANT CREATE_DELETE ON EDGE_TYPES * TO admin;

Follow least privilege principle:
Start with minimal access and gradually add permissions rather than starting with full access and restricting it.
Use roles for grouping permissions:
Define roles based on job functions and assign users to appropriate roles.
Regular permission audits:
cypherSHOW USER PRIVILEGES FOR user_name;

Consider data sensitivity levels:
Create a classification system for your data and adjust permissions accordingly.

Remember that Memgraph's LBAC features are only available in Memgraph Enterprise, not in the Community edition. If you need these privacy controls, you'll need to use the Enterprise version.
